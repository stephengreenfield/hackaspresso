# Hackaspresso
IoT project using a reclaimed electronic scale and this code running on a Spark Photon to tell you how many espresso shots are left in the kitchen

### What it needs:

* the load cell from an electronic scale ($5.00)
* HX711 Load Cell Amplifier ($4.59)
* Spark Photon ($19.00)
* wires and a breadboard ($2.00)

See [here](http://mindsoon.com/hackaspresso) for images on how to hook everything up. Then flash your Spark Photon with `/hackaspresso.cpp` and you're ready to start downing that coffee with the knowledge that you can keep tabs on its stock from afar.
