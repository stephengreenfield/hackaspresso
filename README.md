# Hackaspresso
IoT project using a reclaimed electronic scale and this code running on a Spark Photon to tell you how many espresso shots are left in the kitchen

### What it needs:

* Spark Photon ($19.00)
* HX711 Load Cell Amplifier ($4.59)
* wires and a breadboard ($2.00)
* an old electronic scale ($5.00)

Then flash your Photon and install this script and start downing that coffee with the knowledge that you can keep tabs on the stock from afar.
